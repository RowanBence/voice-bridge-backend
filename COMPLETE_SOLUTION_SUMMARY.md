## üé≠ How It Works Technically

### The Architecture:

```
Custom GPT (in Chrome)
    ‚Üì [Writes character dialogue]
Content Script (monitors page)
    ‚Üì [Detects: [CHARACTER: Name] dialogue]
ttsMP3 API Call
    ‚Üì [Generates audio URL]
HTML5 Audio Player
    ‚Üì [Plays in browser]
System Audio Output ‚Üí Virtual Audio Device
    ‚Üì [Routes to...]
Zoom Microphone Input
    ‚Üì [Everyone hears...]
Character's Voice in Meeting! üéâ
```

### Key Features:

1. **Auto-Detection:**
   - Watches ChatGPT page for messages
   - Detects `[CHARACTER: Name]` pattern
   - Triggers voice generation automatically

2. **Character Mapping:**
   - Each character has their unique voice
   - Viki ‚Üí Amy (British)
   - Kira ‚Üí Joanna (American)
   - Chuck ‚Üí Brian (British)
   - Fin ‚Üí Matthew (American)
   - Charlie ‚Üí Russell (Australian)

3. **Audio Queue:**
   - Multiple characters can speak
   - Queues audio sequentially
   - No overlap or cutting off

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Shows notifications for errors
   - Handles API failures gracefully
   - User-friendly error messages

## üí° Why This Approach?

### I Considered 3 Options:

1. **HTML-only app** (Your original)
   - ‚ùå Can't auto-detect GPT responses
   - ‚ùå Still requires copying/pasting
   - ‚ùå Can't secure API keys

2. **Full backend service** (Too complex)
   - ‚ùå 3-6 months development
   - ‚ùå $50-500/month hosting
   - ‚ùå Complex Zoom SDK integration

3. **Chrome Extension** ‚úÖ (Perfect!)
   - ‚úÖ Auto-detects GPT dialogue
   - ‚úÖ Secure API key storage
   - ‚úÖ Works in 2 weeks
   - ‚úÖ Free to run
   - ‚úÖ Easy to distribute

## üîê Security & API Keys

### Your Concern: "Users won't know what an API is"

**Solution:** Two approaches you can choose:

### Option A: User Gets Their Own Key (Current)
```
Pros:
- You don't pay for their usage
- No liability if they abuse API
- Each user manages their quota

Setup for user:
1. Buy ttsMP3 plan ($)
2. Email support for API key
3. Paste in extension once
4. Never think about it again
```

### Option B: You Provide Keys (Business Model)
```
You could modify the extension to:
1. Remove API key field from UI
2. Embed keys in code (encrypted)
3. User just installs and goes
4. You charge subscription
5. You manage the API costs

This requires:
- Backend validation service
- User authentication
- License key system
- But gives ZERO-step setup for users
```

**For now, Option A is simplest.** If you want Option B (no API setup for users), I can build that next.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do users need programming knowledge?**
A: No. Install extension, add API key, follow setup guide. Done.

**Q: Does it work with any Custom GPT?**
A: Yes, as long as GPT uses `[CHARACTER: Name]` format.

**Q: Can multiple people use same API key?**
A: Yes, but they share the quota. Better for each to have their own.

**Q: What about mobile?**
A: Chrome extensions are desktop-only. Would need separate mobile app.

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**
A: Yes! ttsMP3 allows commercial use of generated audio.

**Q: Will this work in a year?**
A: Should work indefinitely unless ChatGPT or ttsMP3 change their interfaces.

**Q: Can I white-label this?**
A: Absolutely! It's your code now. Rebrand as you wish.
