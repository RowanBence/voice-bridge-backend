# Council Chat Bridge - Setup Guide

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Original Issues:
1. **Browser speechSynthesis**: The old code used the browser's built-in TTS, which cannot be routed to Zoom
2. **No ttsMP3 Integration**: Wasn't actually using the ttsMP3.com API
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper error messages when API calls failed
4. **No Audio Player**: No way to control or route the audio output

### Fixes Applied:
‚úÖ **Proper ttsMP3.com API Integration**: Now correctly calls the ttsMP3 API
‚úÖ **Two API Key Fields**: Separate fields for OpenAI and ttsMP3.com
‚úÖ **Audio Player**: Added HTML5 audio player that can be routed to virtual audio devices
‚úÖ **Better Error Messages**: Clear error messages for common issues (quota, API keys, etc.)
‚úÖ **Character-Specific Voices**: Each character now has an appropriate voice from ttsMP3
‚úÖ **Improved UI**: Better status messages and disabled button during processing
